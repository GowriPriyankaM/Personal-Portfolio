# Personal Portfolio

## Description :

This repo features a Personal Portfolio Webpage I have created using only **HTML** and **CSS** for a certification project in Responsive web design, FreeCodeCamp.

### Objective : 

The main objective of this project is to build a page that is functionally similar to this
**[Website](https://personal-portfolio.freecodecamp.rocks/)**.

### Preview :

*Here's a Preview of how it looks like*

## Contributions :

If you want to contribute to the project, follow the below steps.

1. **Fork the Repository :** Click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner of this page. This creates a copy of the project under your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository :** Once you've forked the repository, you'll want to have a local copy of it on your machine. 
 
      Open the terminal or command prompt, navigate to your desired directory, and run the following command.
 
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/username/Personal-Portfolio.git
      ```
 
      Here, replace "username" with your GitHub username.
 
3. **Create a Branch :** It's good practice to create a new branch for your contributions to keep your changes isolated from the main project. 

      Run the following command to create and switch to a new branch.

      ```
      git switch -c your-branch-name  
      ```
      
      Replace "your-branch-name" with a descriptive name for your branch.

4. **Make Changes :** Open the project in your preferred text editor or IDE and make the necessary changes or additions to the code, documentation, or other project files.

5. **Commit Changes :** After making your changes, save the files and go back to the terminal or command prompt. 

      Use the following command to stage your changes for commit.  

      ```
      git add file-name
      ```

      This command adds all modified and new files for commit. Here, replace "file-name" with the file names.

      Next, commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.

      ```
      git commit -m "Your commit message"
      ```

6. **Push Changes :** Push your local branch with the committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command.

      ```
      git push -u origin your-branch-name
      ```

      Replace "your-branch-name" with the name of the branch you created earlier.

7. **Create a Pull Request :** Once your changes are pushed to your forked repository on GitHub, You should see a message suggesting you create a pull request. 

      Click on the "Compare & pull request" button and provide a clear title and description for your pull request, explaining the changes you've made and submit it.

      *Congratulations! You have successfully contributed to the project.*
